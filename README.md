Javascript-Calculator

Implemented the calculator functions using JavaScript running client-side in the web browser.

This section describes the behavior of the calculator. The calculator itself behaves as a simple four-function calculator.

● The calculator will use the front end that you wrote for the previous homework.
● The number displayed at all times is a single integer value. This value is initially zero (0).
		○ ... unless the user attempts to divide by zero, in which case you should reset the state and display an error message using a JavaScript alert.
● The calculator does integer math (e.g. 9 ÷ 4 = 2).
● No operator precedence. Do the operations in the order they are encountered.
